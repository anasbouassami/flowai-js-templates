# The flow.ai Javascript Response Templates
Easy helper classes to create rich [flow.ai](https://flow.ai) response templates like cards, buttons and locations.

Reponse templates allow developers to render widgets at channels that support this like Facebook Messenger or the flow.ai Web client.

## What can you do?

* No need to write error prone JSON
* Full support for all template types

## Getting started
All classes are available for usage with Flow.ai Cloud functions. When you want to send rich responses using a webhook, install the library with NPM.

### Install

```bash
npm install --save flowai-js-templates
```

### Usage
When writing a Cloud function there is no need to require or import anything. With a webhook you'll need to include the library.

```js
const Template = require('flowai-js-templates')

const card = new Template.Card({
  title: "Cookie factory",
  subtitle: "Infinite lane 23"
})
```

### Sending back rich messages
You can send back rich messages in 3 different ways

#### 1. Cloud function return
Read more about [cloud functions](https://docs.flow.ai/features/cloud-functions.html) how they work.

Within a cloud function you can directly send back response templates by returning them from your function.

```
